# Instructions
1. Create an account in [Wise Sandbox](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech).
2. [IMP] Click on "Skip onboarding" when asked. If asked for OTP it is always "111111". You may use dummy details to create the account.
3. After login, get the API Token from the Settings > Integration and tools > API token. Create a "Full access" token.
4. Once you have an API token you can start working on the code.
5. You will need to modify the 'index.js' to complete the tasks.
6. You can run the code on Replit by clicking the "Run" button at the top (All Node related dependencies will be managed automatically by replit). Alternatively, feel free to download the code and execute it in your preferred code editor. To run the Node.js code in your own environment, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. Then, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and execute the code with `node index.js`
7. Submit the updated code and the console logs.
